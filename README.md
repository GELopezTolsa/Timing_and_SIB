Abstract

It has been suggested that schedule-induced behaviors allow organisms to adapt better to temporal regularities of the environment. The main goal of the present study was to observe the effect of schedule-induced drinking (SID) on the performance in fixed-interval (FI) schedules. Rats were exposed to a FI 15, 30 or 60 s food reinforcement schedule, and only half of them had access to water in the experimental chamber. Rats with access to water developed SID, which occurred in the first part of the interval, regardless of the FI value, and was followed by an increase in lever pressing rate. There were no substantial differences in the quantitative measures of timing between groups that had or did not have access to water, except for the rats in the FI 15 s group with access to water, that showed longer post-reinforcement pauses, possibly due to competition between SID and lever pressing. SID did not manifest the scalar property, contrary to lever pressing, but it is proposed that behaviors are displayed serially until the last behavior before the target operant response becomes a discriminative stimulus for that behavior. It is not assumed that the purpose of schedule-induced behaviors is to aid timing, but the development of behavioral patterns might determine the performance of organisms on temporal tasks. Additionally, in some cases competition between responses might exert more control on when the operant behavior occurs than timing. Timing seems to consist in the temporal organization of available behaviors that leads to a specific behavior occurring at a specified time, a single characteristic that typically had come to indicate ‘accurate timing’.
